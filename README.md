# AR-Workshop:  Part 1,2,3 combined
This is the simple app that I built to introduce myself into AR.<br/> 
It combine concepts from different sources and things I enjoyed with.<br/>
I like animals, that's why I used them.<br/>
Feel free to make Pull Requests in case you wanna make it into a better app<br/>

***How to***
- Launch the app and detect a scene
- Tap on any animal to add it to a scene. You can have multiple scenes
- Click on MENU to change behavior. Each animal can have a different area even though they're all display together as long as there are in different scenes.
